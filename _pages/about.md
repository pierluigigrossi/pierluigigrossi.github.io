**Studying to get my CCIE Service Provider**

My current interest is on IP backbone networks in large Service Providers(mainly), Datacenters and enterprises. 
I'm playing with SRv6 and operating on SR-MPLS with TI-LFA . [find out more](/ip)


Programming langague I use more frequently, of  course to automate networks:
linux shell, Python, Java


OS I like the most is  RedHat Enterprise Linux. 

I came from the the Fixed Telephone Network world [find out more](/voice), now i abandonded studying the topic but I don't regret  exprimenting with it in my free time. Il primo amore non si dimentica mai !
