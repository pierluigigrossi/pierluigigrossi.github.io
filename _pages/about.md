**Studying to get my CCIE Service Provider**

I'm currently interested in IP backbone networks: large Service Providers (mainly), Datacenters and enterprises.

I'm playing with [SRv6](https://www.segment-routing.net/ietf) and operating on SR-MPLS (Segment Routing MPLS) with TI-LFA (Topology Indipendent Loop Free Alternate). [find out more](/ip)


Programming langague I use to automate networks:
linux shell, Python, Java

Back to where it all began: Fixed Telephone Network [find out more](/voice). 
I don't regret exprimenting with it in my free time.

Topics I had the chance to work with:

* Routers and Voice: view dedicated pages 
* Hypervisors: VMWare ESXI, KVM
* Mail: Postfix, Microsoft Exchange 2013,  both setup from scratch ðŸ˜±
* Web: Apache, PHP, MYSQL,NGINX,SQL Server, IIS, ASP
* Monitoring: Nagios,Zabbix,Splunk
* OS: Windows Server(Active Directory, DNS, CA, NPS...), Red Hat, Debian
