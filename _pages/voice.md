**PBX, in italian "centralino"**

When I was 8 years old I ran a mini analog Phone Branch Exchange at home.

I was really passionate about Ericsson MD110, one of the most advanced Digital PBX at that time. 

 I had the chance to put my hands, as a 12 years old boy, on a [Cisco 1701](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/obsolete/routers/cisco-1701-adsl-security-access-router.html) ADSL router. 


The summer before I started attending liceo classico, high school, I gained exprience with linux and setup an [Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org) PBX.
Asterisk is an awsome opensource PBX that I still run at home.
This way I learned to love and use linux: create interactive voice appliance  with MYSQL and PHP to: filter spam calls, select certain Caller IDs etc... 

Other things I tested on my voice home lab: Cisco CUCM, CUBE, Skinny protocol etc.

Registered tons of SIP phones on asterisk, a recap of the most challenging ones: Cisco 79xx,88xx ,Avaya 96xx



**SIP Protocol**
My dream was to connect digitally to the PSTN carrier.
I would have bought an ISDN line but my parents didn't let me do that, so a cheap Betamax SIP trunk was the way to go.

I wasn't satisfied at all with the overall quality and stability of the system,  due to the poor internet connection, that day I began to study IP networks, starting from  SIP protocol and then down to all layers and architectures.
I soon realized my poor ADSL line couldn't achieve an acceptable voice quality and I needed at least QoS.


I abandoned studying voice.Last thing I dived into is IP Multimedia Subsystem and voice interconnections , both TDM and IP, between carriers.
