**PBX, in italian "centralino"**

When I was 8 years old I succesfully setup a mini analog Phone Branch Exchange at home.

I was really passionate about Ericsson MD110, one of the most advanced Digital PBX at that time. Studying TDM I easily understood the benefetis  IP and VoIP(mainly SIP) protocols brings.

At 12 years old I had the chanche to put my hands on a [Cisco 1701](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/obsolete/routers/cisco-1701-adsl-security-access-router.html) ADSL router. 
I fell in love with Cisco, from 79xx VoIP Phones and solutions.

The summer before I started attending liceo classico, high school, I gained exprience with linux and setup an [Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org) PBX.
Asterisk is an awsome opensource PBX witch I currently run at home.
This way I learned to love and use and customize linux, created Voice appliance on asterisk to interact with MYSQL,PHP, filter spam calls etc... 

I've tested on my home lab: Cisco CUCM, CUBE, Skinny protocol etc.

On my asterisk PBX during more than 15 years I've registered various tons of phones,the most challenging one: Cisco 79xx to 88xx ,Avaya 99xx,



**SIP Protocol**

I soon realized, on my poor ADSL line ,I need QoS  to achieve an accetable voice quality. 
From that day I began studying IP networks in detail and service providers. I started from the SIP protocol and then down to all layers.

IP multimedia system always fascinated me, in the way it conncets both mobile and fixed users thanks to the power of IP, and that's the last thing I studied on voice networks (including how to manage interconnections between SBCs )

I had the oppportunity to live the migration of an italian Carrier Voice interconnnection from TDM to IP and SIP.
